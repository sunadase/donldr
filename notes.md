### async downloader


concurrent download for http requires:
- supporting bytes[^1]
    ```rust
    let server_supports_bytes = 
    match headers.get(header::ACCEPT_RANGES) {
        Some(val) => val == "bytes",
        None => false,
    };
    ```
    if ACCEPT RANGES key in header is set to "bytes"
    
- header contains CONTENT LENGTH key[^2]

if server supports bytes and header contains key RANGE (and concurrent) -> remove header RANGE
`why?`

If an HTTP response includes the Accept-Ranges header and its value is anything other than "none", then the server supports range requests.
If they don't support ranges -> Can't stop/resume or chunk download
what about:
```
Range: bytes=900-
```
all bytes after [900, ...]
while limiting the accepted bytes client side? (terminate after n bytes or smth)
so concurrency with
[0-](1024) [1024-](1024) [2048-](1024) [3096-](1024) ...
(1024) bytes are the soft size limit at which the client interrupts the get request somehow, and only use that portion?

request:
```
GET /z4d4kWk.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: i.imgur.com
Range: bytes=0-1023
```
results in:
```
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/146515
Content-Length: 1024
â€¦
```
so the range is inclusive in both sides: [from, to]  len:(to-from+1)


file io:
- download chunks as seperate files rewrite as whole later `ugly`
- download keep in memory write as a whole `issue w big files`
- mmap?
    - can't share mmap(?) &mut [u8] between tasks? could do actor pattern mpsc but whats the point of mmap then. technically i should be able to share them as theyre distinct regions of memory, but will rust let me - do i have to use unsafe ptrs?. but the regions are created from slices of the whole mmap?
- iouring?
- streams / tokio::io::copy
- fs [write_at](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/fs/trait.FileExt.html#tymethod.write_at)
- streaming the response body chunks it automatically? [1](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/async-download-very-large-files/79621), [2](https://webscraping.ai/faq/reqwest/what-is-the-best-way-to-handle-large-file-downloads-with-reqwest)
